				<li>PREYER SERVICES 5TIMES A DAY <p>One of the core services the Mosque Foundation offers is Prayer Services. The Mosque Foundation is a full time Mosque that conducts 5 daily prayer services 7 days a week all year long. Additionally, the Mosque Foundation holds 2 Friday prayers due to space and parking lots limitations. The timing for each prayer is posted on the right side of the home page (main page).
				Five separate times a day (dawn, noon, late afternoon, dusk, and evening), our Mosque is available for worshippers to come and perform the sacred and beautiful act of worship in congregation.

				<li>MARRIAGE SERVICES <p>We offer pre-marriage advice to couples about to join each other in the holy bond and commitment of matrimony. We perform the formal marriage service, in conjunction with State requirements and documentation. </p></li>
				<li>ASK THE IMAAM <p>Often times we are confronted with a situation in which the right choice is not clear or we simply are not aware of the best ethical decision to make. The Mosque Foundation offers people opportunities to ask our Imams about these situations and how Islam’s sacred law addresses them. </p></li>
				<li>EDUCATIONAL SERVICES <p>The Mosque Foundation holds regular lectures and special events in which our community may expand their knowledge. The programs include Quran commentary and wisdom, details of sacred law, lessons from the life of the Prophet (peace be upon him), history of Muslim civilization, the proper performance of rites of worship (like prayer and Hajj), civic issues and duties, and much more.</p></li>
				<li> ARBITRATION <p>Whenever disagreements arise (whether they involve business matters or other aspects of life), it is useful to seek an impartial arbiter to help solve the problem. The Mosque Foundation offers objective arbitration to solve disputes and preserve relations between the disputants. </p></li>
