Do not inflate prices on one another. Do not hate one another.
				Do not turn your backs on one another. Do not undersell one another; but rather, be worshipers of Allah and brothers. The Muslim is the brother of his fellow Muslim. He does not oppress him, nor does he abandon him, nor does he lie to him, nor does he belittle him. Taqwa is here” and he pointed to his chest three times. “It is a sufficient act of evil that a person belittles his Muslim brother. Every Muslim to another Muslim is sacred, his blood, his wealth, and his honor.” 
				[Sahih MuslimThe Messenger of Allah (sal Allahu alaihi wa sallam) said: “Every joint of a person must do a charity every day that the sun rises. Acting justly between two people is a charity, assisting a man onto his mount, or hoisting his belongings onto it is a charity, a good word is a charity, every step you take to perform the prayer is a charity, and removing harmful objects from the roadway is a charity.[Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim
